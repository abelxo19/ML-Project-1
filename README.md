# Predicting-Building-Energy-Efficiency
ML Project that Predicts Building Energy Efficiency
# 🏢 Building Energy Efficiency Rating Predictor

## 📘 Scenario
You are working with an architecture firm to improve building designs. Your task is to develop a machine learning model that predicts a building’s **energy efficiency rating** based on features like wall area, roof area, and overall height.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency)
- Target: Heating Load (used as a proxy for energy efficiency)

## ⚙️ Features Used
- Wall Area
- Roof Area
- Overall Height
- Orientation
- Glazing Area

## 🤖 Model
- Type: Regression
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- MAE: ~0.7
- R² Score: ~0.98
- Very accurate for early-stage design evaluations

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## 🧠 Goal
Help architects make better decisions before physical modeling by predicting how efficient their building structure will be based on basic design parameters.

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open the Google Colab notebook
2. Run cells sequentially
3. Review predictions and plots
